# SkyCash

SkyCash is new approach to charity.
We enable distribiuted charity actions, where user can gather money for a cause she had choosen among the friends.
Thanks to talking advantage of the SIXP2P payment API we are able to proceed payments in a very fast and cheaper way.

User can find a sponsor of his efforts - either that be family member or group of friends - and recieve rewards for 
her effort, which can either go for hers own pocket or to account of a choosen charity.

This projects integrates new API of SIX for P2P payments, and Runkeeper API for getting fitness activtities data of a user.
